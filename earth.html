    <p>
        From the perspective we get on Earth,
        our planet appears to be big and sturdy with an
        endless ocean of air.
        From space, astronauts often get the
        impression that the Earth is small with a thin, fragile
        layer of atmosphere.
        For a space traveler, the distinguishing Earth features
        are the blue waters, brown and green land masses
        and white clouds set against a black background.

    </p><p>Many dream of traveling in space and viewing the wonders of the universe.
    In reality all of us are space
    travelers. Our spaceship is the planet Earth, traveling
    at the speed of 108,000 kilometers (67,000 miles) an hour.

    </p>
        kilometers (93.2 million miles). It takes 365.256 days for the Earth to travel around the Sun and
        23.9345 hours for the Earth rotate a complete revolution. It has a
        diameter of 12,756 kilometers (7,973 miles), only a few hundred kilometers larger than that
        of Venus. Our atmosphere is composed of 78 percent nitrogen,
        21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other constituents.

    </p><p>Earth is the only planet in the solar system known to harbor life.
        Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give rise to
        an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the atmosphere,
        shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from
        the Sun and other stars. Earth's atmosphere protects us from
        meteors, most of which burn up before they can strike the
        surface.

    </p><p>From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our
        home planet. The first American satellite, Explorer 1,
        discovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen
        radiation belts.  This layer is formed from rapidly moving
        charged particles that are trapped by the Earth's magnetic field in a
        doughnut-shaped region surrounding the equator.
        Other findings from satellites
        show that our planet's magnetic field is distorted into a
        tear-drop shape by the solar wind.
        We also now know that
        our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and uneventful,
        seethes with activity -- swelling by day and contracting by night.
        Affected by changes in solar activity, the upper atmosphere
        contributes to weather and climate on Earth.

    </p><p>Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives rise
        to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged
        particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic
        field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's magnetic
        poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the
        auroras or the northern and southern lights.
