        Our solar system consists of an average star we call the
        <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>, the planets
        <a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a>, <a href="venus.html">Venus</a>,
        <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>, <a href="mars.html">Mars</a>,
        <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>, <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>,
        <a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a>, <a href="neptune.html">Neptune</a>, and
        <a href="pluto.html">Pluto</a>. It includes: the satellites of the
        planets; numerous <a href="comet.htm">comets</a>,
        <a href="asteroid.htm">asteroids</a>, and meteoroids; and the
        interplanetary medium. The Sun is the richest source of electromagnetic
        energy (mostly in the form of heat and light) in the solar system. The
        Sun's nearest known stellar neighbor is a red dwarf star called Proxima
        Centauri, at a distance of 4.3 light years away. The whole solar system,
        together with the local stars
        visible on a clear night, orbits the center of our home galaxy, a spiral
        disk of 200 billion stars we call the Milky Way.
        The Milky Way has two small galaxies orbiting it nearby, which are
        visible from the southern hemisphere. They are called the Large
        Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud. The nearest large
        galaxy is the Andromeda Galaxy. It is a spiral
        galaxy like the Milky Way but is 4 times as massive and is 2 million
        light years away. Our galaxy, one of billions of galaxies known, is
        traveling through intergalactic space.

        <p>
            The planets, most of the satellites of the planets and the
            asteroids revolve around the Sun in the same direction,
            in nearly circular orbits.
            When looking down from above the Sun's north pole,
            the planets orbit in a counter-clockwise direction.
            The planets orbit the Sun in or near the same plane, called the
            <a href="terms.htm#ecliptic"><i>ecliptic</i></a>. Pluto is a special
            case in that its orbit is the most
            highly inclined (18 degrees) and the most highly elliptical of all the
            planets. Because of this, for part of its orbit, Pluto is closer
            to the Sun than is
            <a href="neptune.htm">Neptune</a>. The axis of rotation for most of the planets
            is nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic. The exceptions are
            <a href="uranus.htm">Uranus</a> and <a href="pluto.htm">Pluto</a>,
            which are tipped on their sides.

        </p><h3><a name="comp">Composition Of The Solar System</a></h3>
        The Sun contains 99.85% of all the matter in the Solar System.
        The planets, which condensed out of the same disk of material
        that formed the Sun, contain only 0.135% of the mass of the solar system.
        Jupiter contains more than twice the matter of all the other planets
        combined. Satellites of the planets, comets, asteroids, meteoroids,
        and the interplanetary medium constitute the remaining 0.015%.
        The following table is a list of the mass distribution within
        our Solar System.

        <ul>
            <li> Sun: 99.85%
            </li><li> Planets: 0.135%
        </li><li> Comets: 0.01% ?
        </li><li> Satellites: 0.00005%
        </li><li> Minor Planets: 0.0000002% ?
        </li><li> Meteoroids: 0.0000001% ?
        </li><li> Interplanetary Medium: 0.0000001% ?
        </li></ul>
        <p>

        </p><h3><a name="space">Interplanetary Space</a></h3>
    Nearly all the solar system by volume appears to be an empty void.
    Far from being nothingness, this vacuum of "space" comprises the
    interplanetary medium. It includes various forms of energy and at
    least two material components: interplanetary dust and interplanetary
    gas. Interplanetary dust consists of microscopic solid particles.
    Interplanetary gas is a tenuous flow of gas and charged particles,
    mostly protons and electrons -- <a href="terms.htm#plasma">plasma</a>
    -- which stream from the <a href="sun.htm">Sun</a>, called the
    <a href="terms.htm#solarwind">solar wind</a>.

    <p>
        The solar wind can be measured by spacecraft, and it has a large effect
        on comet tails. It also has a measurable effect on the motion of
        spacecraft. The speed of the solar wind is about 400 kilometers
        (250 miles) per second
        in the vicinity of Earth's orbit. The point at which the solar wind
        meets the interstellar medium, which is the "solar" wind from other
        stars, is called the heliopause. It is a boundary theorized to be
        roughly circular or teardrop-shaped, marking the edge of the Sun's
        influence perhaps 100 AU from the Sun. The space within the boundary
        of the heliopause, containing the Sun and solar system, is referred to
        as the heliosphere.
    </p><p>
    The solar magnetic field extends outward into interplanetary space;
    it can be measured on Earth and by spacecraft. The solar magnetic
    field is the dominating magnetic field throughout the
    interplanetary regions of the solar system, except in the immediate
    environment of planets which have their own magnetic fields.

    </p><h3>The Terrestrial Planets</h3>
        The terrestrial planets are the four innermost planets in the solar
        system, <a href="mercury.htm">Mercury</a>,
        <a href="venus.htm">Venus</a>, <a href="earth.htm">Earth</a> and
        <a href="mars.htm">Mars</a>. They are called terrestrial because they
        have a compact, rocky surface like the Earth's. The planets, Venus,
        Earth, and Mars have significant atmospheres while Mercury has almost
        none. The following diagram shows the approximate distance of the
        terrestrial planets to the Sun.

        </p><h3>The Jovian Planets</h3>
        <a href="jupiter.htm">Jupiter</a>, <a href="saturn.htm">Saturn</a>,
        <a href="uranus.htm">Uranus</a>, and <a href="neptune.htm">Neptune</a>
        are known as the Jovian (Jupiter-like) planets, because they are all
        gigantic compared with Earth, and they have a gaseous nature like
        Jupiter's. The Jovian planets are also referred to as the <i>gas
        giants</i>, although some or all of them might have small solid cores.
        The following diagram shows the approximate distance of the Jovian
        planets to the Sun.

        * The Sun's period of rotation at the surface varies from
        approximately 25 days at the equator to 36 days at the poles. Deep
        down, below the convective zone, everything appears to rotate with
        a period of 27 days.
